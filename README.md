## Markdown and Git Practice                                                                                                                                                                                                                    This project is a way of familiarizing myself with the markdown format.                                                 It is also a way of practicing Git more.                                                                                This project will therefore feature multiple commits and at least one branch and a merge commit.                        I plan to use .gitignore, probably with some arbitrary files (e.g. node modules or something else that would typically go in .gitignore).                                                                                                       I might also try rebase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        > You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
