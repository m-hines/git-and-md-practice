# Markdown Practice

This document is for practicing the *markdown format* and using *git*. **Several** commits have been made.

## Primary:

* markdown
* git branches
* git merge
* merge conflicts
* .gitignore

### Secondary:

1. Put another project on Github
2. Write a good README.md
3. Learn more about **Neovim** (e.g. how to exit a file without saving)
4. Learn how to git log the graph with branches

#### To Do List

* look up what a good README contains
* write a good README
* make a branch  [complete]
* merge main branch with another branch  [I know the command, but I'm still fuzzy on when to do this and what effects it has]
* merge another branch with main branch  [still fuzzy]
* create and solve a merge conflict  [incomplete]
* display md file on web browser  [incomplete]
* learn how to use neovim more  [incomplete]

###### Notes

* to exit neovim without saving, use command q!

> *You miss 100% of the shots you don't take*
